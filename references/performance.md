# Performance

## Core Web Vitals Targets

Slow page loads lose readers before the first chapter. Fiction reading sites have no tolerance for sluggish chapter transitions.

| Metric | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LCP | < 2.5s | Largest contentful paint at the 75th percentile of real users (Google "good" threshold; > 4s is "poor"). On a fiction site the LCP element is usually the first cover image or the chapter's opening heading. |
| INP | < 200ms | Reader controls (theme switch, font size) must be instant |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Font loading and image loading must not cause visible layout shifts |
| TTFB | < 600ms | For server-rendered routes; SSG from Vercel edge CDN targets < 100ms |

### Verification strategy

**Default (fast, unattended):**
- Build the site (`pnpm run build`).
- Check the build output for warnings about large JS bundles or unoptimized images.
- Run automated smoke tests with `curl` against the started server (see `qa-checklist.md`).
- Verify cover images are WebP (lossy q82) and comfortably under 300KB (q82 typically lands ~50–60KB).

**Deep audit (only when user explicitly asks):**
- Test on simulated mobile (Moto G4 equivalent) at Slow 3G in Chrome DevTools Lighthouse. Do not test only on fast desktop connections.

Do not block the pipeline on a full Lighthouse run by default.

## LCP — Largest Contentful Paint

### What is the LCP element on a fiction site

| Page | LCP element | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home / catalog | First visible book cover `<img>` | Usually the top-left cover in a grid |
| Book detail | Hero cover `<img>` | Larger display size than grid |
| Chapter reader | `<h1>` chapter heading | No image involved — fast HTML delivery is the lever |

On chapter reader pages, image optimization does not affect LCP. SSG + CDN delivery is the only LCP lever there.

### `next/image` priority and preload

**Next.js ≤15:** Use the `priority` prop. It injects `<link rel="preload" as="image" imagesrcset="..." imagesizes="...">` in `<head>`, triggering the browser's preload scanner before the `<img>` element is parsed in the body. This is what makes the difference on SSG where the image is always rendered below the initial scan position.

```jsx
// Apply only to the first visible cover — the one that will be the LCP element
<Image
  src={books[0].cover}
  width={160}
  height={240}
  sizes="(max-width: 480px) 160px, 200px"
  priority   // injects <link rel="preload"> in <head>
  alt={books[0].title}
/>
```

**Next.js 16+:** `priority` is deprecated. Use `fetchPriority="high"` + `loading="eager"` instead. Do not combine `preload` and `fetchPriority` — the docs warn against this.

```jsx
// Next.js 16+
<Image
  src={books[0].cover}
  fetchPriority="high"
  loading="eager"
  width={160}
  height={240}
  sizes="(max-width: 480px) 160px, 200px"
  alt={books[0].title}
/>
```

Apply to **only the first visible cover** (the LCP candidate). Every other cover should use the default `loading="lazy"`.

### `sizes` prop is mandatory

Without `sizes`, Next.js assumes the image is 100vw wide and generates an oversized srcset. With correct `sizes`, the browser picks the smallest adequate variant. Omitting `sizes` on a 160px cover causes the browser to download a 1200px image on mobile.

```jsx
// Cover grid — 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on desktop
<Image
  src={book.cover}
  width={160}
  height={240}
  sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(50vw - 24px), (max-width: 768px) 160px, 200px"
  loading="lazy"
  alt={book.title}
/>

// Hero cover on book detail page
<Image
  src={book.cover}
  width={180}
  height={270}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 180px, 220px"
  priority
  alt={book.title}
/>
```

### SSG advantage for LCP

SSG pages are served from Vercel's edge CDN with TTFB < 100ms globally. `LCPAttribution.timeToFirstByte` is a direct LCP sub-component — SSG eliminates server compute latency entirely. For a fiction site, always prefer SSG (`generateStaticParams` + default output) over SSR.

---

## INP — Interaction to Next Paint

INP measures responsiveness: every tap, click, and keypress. Target < 200ms. The primary INP killers on ad-monetized fiction sites are long tasks from third-party scripts during page load.

### INP breakdown

INP = input delay + processing duration + presentation delay

- **Input delay**: Time waiting for long tasks (ad scripts) to finish before event handlers run. Dominant on page load.
- **Processing duration**: Time running your event handlers. Dominant post-load.
- **Presentation delay**: Layout/paint after handlers complete.

### Breaking up long tasks with `scheduler.yield()`

Ad scripts (GPT.js, AdSense) create long tasks (> 50ms) during initialization that block the main thread. When a user taps during this window, the interaction is queued — this is input delay.

Use `scheduler.yield()` to break ad initialization into yielding chunks:

```javascript
// scheduler.yield() is Chrome 129+, Firefox 142+. Polyfill for Safari:
function yieldToMain() {
  if (globalThis.scheduler?.yield) return scheduler.yield();
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}

// Break ad initialization into yielding steps
async function initAdSlot(slotId, sizes, divId) {
  const slot = googletag.defineSlot(slotId, sizes, divId);
  await yieldToMain(); // yield — user input can now be handled
  slot.addService(googletag.pubads());
  await yieldToMain();
  googletag.display(divId);
}
```

**`scheduler.yield()` advantage over `setTimeout(fn, 0)`:** Continuation is prioritized over fresh tasks from the same source — your ad code picks up where it left off rather than going to the back of the task queue.

**`isInputPending()` is no longer recommended** — superseded by `scheduler.yield()`.

### Batch long jobs in 50ms chunks

```javascript
async function runJobs(jobs) {
  let lastYield = performance.now();
  for (const job of jobs) {
    job();
    if (performance.now() - lastYield > 50) {
      await yieldToMain();
      lastYield = performance.now();
    }
  }
}
```

### Reader UI controls (theme toggle, font size)

Theme toggle and font size are pure CSS state changes — they must not trigger React re-renders that cascade into ad slot re-renders.

- **Theme toggle**: swap `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. CSS-only, zero JS reflow.
- **Font size**: swap a CSS custom property or `data-font-size` attribute. Same principle.
- **Memo isolation**: wrap `<AdSlot>` components in `React.memo` so reader UI state changes don't cause ad slot re-renders.

```tsx
const AdSlot = React.memo(function AdSlot({ slotId }: { slotId: string }) {
  // ... ad setup
});
```

### GPT deferred loading to protect LCP window

Use `disableInitialLoad: true` to defer ad fetching until after LCP:

```javascript
googletag.cmd.push(() => {
  googletag.setConfig({
    singleRequest: true,
    disableInitialLoad: true,  // prevents ad fetch during LCP window
  });
  googletag.pubads().setForceSafeFrame(true);
  googletag.enableServices();
});

// In AdSlot component — fetch when slot enters viewport
function fetchAd(slot) {
  googletag.cmd.push(() => googletag.pubads().refresh([slot]));
}
```

---

## CLS — Cumulative Layout Shift

### Ad slots are the #1 CLS source

GPT/AdSense slots render as zero-height divs by default. When the ad creative loads, it pushes surrounding content — this is layout shift. The fix is always to reserve space before the ad loads.

**Always use `min-height` (not `height`) on ad containers:**

```css
/* Correct — reserves smallest configured size, expands for larger ads */
#div-gpt-ad-q1,
#div-gpt-ad-q2,
#div-gpt-ad-q3,
#div-gpt-ad-q4 {
  min-width: 250px;
  min-height: 250px; /* smallest size in the slot's size array */
}
```

**Never use fixed `height`** — it crops larger ads. `min-height` reserves the smallest configured size and gracefully expands.

**Never use JavaScript to reserve space** — JS-driven reservations run after layout, which may already have happened, causing a shift.

### Fluid slots (q5)

Fluid-size ads (q5 in the nablepart setup) have unknown height until the creative loads. Place fluid slots only below the fold. CLS from below-fold content after 500ms of user interaction is scored under the windowed CLS model and affects the score less — but still avoid them above the fold.

### GPT lazy loading with explicit margins

Configure lazy loading with explicit viewport margins to prevent late-loading CLS. Fetch the ad early (5 viewports away) so it loads before it becomes visible:

```javascript
googletag.setConfig({
  lazyLoad: {
    fetchMarginPercent: 500,  // fetch when within 5 viewports of viewport edge
    renderMarginPercent: 200, // render when within 2 viewports
    mobileScaling: 2.0,       // double margins on mobile (smaller viewport + faster scroll)
  }
});
```

### Font swap CLS

`font-display: swap` alone does **not** prevent layout shift — the swap from fallback to web font still moves text. To hold CLS near zero:

- Use `next/font` — it applies a `size-adjust` / `ascent-override` fallback metric automatically, making the fallback font match the web font's line metrics before the swap.
- Do not claim `swap` "fixes" CLS. It only prevents FOIT (invisible text). CLS from the swap still occurs unless fallback metrics are matched.

### Images and CLS

Always set `width` and `height` on every `<Image>` — the browser reserves the correct aspect-ratio space in the layout before the image loads. Missing dimensions cause a height-from-zero shift when the image arrives.

---

## Third-Party Script Loading Strategies

### `next/script` strategy reference

| Strategy | Timing | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `beforeInteractive` | Before hydration | Critical polyfills only — never use for ads |
| `afterInteractive` | After hydration (default) | GPT.js, AdSense, Facebook Pixel |
| `lazyOnload` | Browser idle (`requestIdleCallback`) | Low-priority tracking, non-revenue analytics |
| `worker` | Web Worker via Partytown | **App Router: NOT SUPPORTED** |

**`worker` strategy does not work with App Router.** It only works with Pages Router. Do not attempt Partytown integration with App Router fiction sites.

### Recommended strategy per script

```tsx
import Script from 'next/script'

// GPT.js — afterInteractive: must load after hydration, ad slots need the DOM
<Script
  id="gpt"
  src="https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/tag/js/gpt.js"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>

// GPT initialization — inline script after the library
<Script id="gpt-init" strategy="afterInteractive">
  {`
    window.googletag = window.googletag || {cmd: []};
    googletag.cmd.push(function() {
      googletag.setConfig({singleRequest: true});
      googletag.pubads().setForceSafeFrame(true);
      googletag.enableServices();
    });
  `}
</Script>

// AdSense — afterInteractive
<Script
  id="adsense"
  src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXX"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>

// Facebook Pixel — afterInteractive
<Script id="facebook-pixel" strategy="afterInteractive">
  {`
    !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
    {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
    n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
    if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
    n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
    t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
    'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
    fbq('init', 'PIXEL_ID');
    fbq('track', 'PageView');
  `}
</Script>
```

**Revenue trade-off:** `lazyOnload` delays ad requests, which reduces ad fill and revenue. For display ad monetization, use `afterInteractive` for GPT/AdSense. Mitigate the INP/TBT cost with `scheduler.yield()` in your ad initialization code (see INP section).

### `@next/third-parties` for GTM/GA4

For Google Analytics and GTM, prefer the Chrome Aurora / Vercel maintained package over raw `next/script`:

```bash
pnpm add @next/third-parties
```

```tsx
import { GoogleTagManager, GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'

// In layout.tsx
<GoogleTagManager gtmId="GTM-XXXXX" />
<GoogleAnalytics gaId="G-XXXXX" />
```

This does not yet cover GPT.js or AdSense — use `next/script` directly for those.

---

## Images

Book covers are the heaviest assets on the home and detail pages.

- Target < 80KB per cover at display size (typically 160×240px on mobile).
- Always set `width` and `height` on `<Image>` to prevent CLS during load.
- Use `loading="lazy"` for all below-fold covers on the home page.
- Use `priority` (or `fetchPriority="high"` + `loading="eager"` on Next.js 16+) on the first visible cover only.
- Ship covers and illustrations as lossy WebP — no `<picture>`/JPEG fallback needed (WebP is supported by every modern browser).
- CSS cover placeholders are acceptable when no image is provided. They must use flat color or subtle texture, not heavy gradients or box shadows.

### Cover compression (B5 step)

AI-generated covers are PNG and typically 400–800 KB. Convert to lossy **WebP q82** — this consistently brings covers to ~50–60 KB with no visible loss at display size. Prefer `cwebp`, fall back to Pillow:

```bash
mkdir -p public/covers
for f in public/covers/*.png; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  slug="$(basename "$f" .png)"
  out="public/covers/${slug}.webp"
  if command -v cwebp &>/dev/null; then
    cwebp -quiet -q 82 "$f" -o "$out"
  else
    python3 -c "from PIL import Image; im=Image.open('$f'); im.save('$out','webp',quality=82,method=6)"
  fi
  rm -f "$f"
done
```

**Never use lossless WebP** — on photographic covers it is ~3× larger than the source PNG. After conversion, ensure all `cover` paths in `src/lib/books.ts` use `.webp` and rebuild.

### `placeholder="blur"` for progressive loading

For covers loaded from static paths (not static imports), generate a tiny blurDataURL at build time:

```typescript
// Generate a 10×15px base64 WebP — ~20 bytes, sufficient for a blur placeholder
import sharp from 'sharp'

async function genBlur(coverAbsPath: string): Promise<string> {
  const buf = await sharp(coverAbsPath)
    .resize(10)
    .webp({ quality: 40 })
    .toBuffer()
  return `data:image/webp;base64,${buf.toString('base64')}`
}
```

Store the blurDataURL in `books.ts` alongside the cover path and pass it to `<Image>`:

```tsx
<Image
  src={book.cover}
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={book.blurDataURL}
  width={160}
  height={240}
  sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(50vw - 24px), 160px"
  loading="lazy"
  alt={book.title}
/>
```

**Do not use a large blurDataURL** (e.g., full-res base64 of the original image). A 50KB blurDataURL is inlined into HTML and hurts more than no placeholder.

### AVIF vs WebP

Next.js on Vercel automatically serves AVIF (25–70% smaller than JPEG/PNG) when the browser supports it, then WebP, then original. This is handled transparently by the Image Optimization API when deploying to Vercel without `output: 'export'`. No code change required.

For static export (pre-built images), stick with the cwebp WebP pipeline — AVIF encoding is 5–10× slower and the savings at cover display sizes are less significant.

### Static export image limitation

When using `output: 'export'`, the Next.js Image Optimization API (`/_next/image`) does not exist — it requires a server. Two options:

**Option 1 — `unoptimized: true` (recommended):** Pass pre-built WebP files through without re-processing. Works correctly with the cwebp build pipeline.

```javascript
// next.config.js — for static hosts (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages static, etc.)
module.exports = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: { unoptimized: true },
}
```

**Option 2 — `next-image-export-optimizer`:** Generates responsive srcset variants and blurDataURL at build time. Automates the manual cwebp step but adds setup complexity.

**For Vercel deployment (not static export):** Do NOT set `output: 'export'` and do NOT set `unoptimized: true`. Let the Image Optimization API handle format conversion and responsive serving. Recommended `next.config.js` for Vercel:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // No output: 'export' — Vercel handles image optimization automatically
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  },
}
```

---

## Fonts

- Prefer system font stacks for body text. Do not load a web font for body reading — system stacks render faster and are often better for CJK.
- On Next.js, load any display font (titles, logo) via `next/font` instead of a CDN `<link>`. `next/font` self-hosts Google Fonts as static assets served from your own deployment domain — the browser never requests Google at runtime, so no `preconnect` is needed and there is no third-party dependency or GDPR exposure. A failed font download fails the build rather than silently falling back to the Google CDN.
- `font-display: swap` alone does **not** prevent layout shift — the swap from fallback to web font still moves text and counts against CLS. To actually hold CLS near zero, use `next/font` (it applies a size-adjusted fallback metric automatically) or define a fallback with matching `size-adjust`/`ascent-override`. Do not claim swap "fixes" CLS.
- Subset any loaded font to the characters actually used (Latin, CJK range as appropriate). `next/font` with `subsets: ['latin']` handles this.
- Never load a CJK web font for body text on mobile. The system stack (Hiragino, Yu Mincho, Noto) is always faster and equally good.
- If a custom reader font is offered as a setting, load it lazily only when the reader selects it.

---

## Chapter Content Loading

- Never bundle all chapter text into the initial HTML or JS payload.
- For static builds: generate one HTML file or JSON file per chapter and navigate between them.
- For SPA/Next.js: lazy-load chapter content when entering the reader route. Do not prefetch every chapter at book-detail load time.
- Prefetch only the next chapter when the reader reaches 80% of the current chapter.
- Avoid loading the full book catalog on a chapter reader page.

### Next.js App Router prefetch behavior

Chapter navigation is the hot path; lean on the framework's native prefetching rather than rolling your own.

- **Statically rendered chapter routes** (the `generateStaticParams` + SSG path this skill recommends) are fully prefetched by `<Link>` when they enter the viewport, and cached client-side for ~5 minutes by default. This is what makes prev/next feel instant — no extra code needed.
- **Dynamically rendered chapter routes** are *not* prefetched at all unless a `loading.js` boundary exists, in which case only the shell up to that boundary is prefetched. If your reader must be dynamic, add a `loading.tsx` so the layout/skeleton still prefetches. Prefer SSG to avoid this entirely.
- **Sibling navigation** (chapter N → N+1) reuses the shared parent layout and only fetches the changed leaf segment. Keep the reader chrome (header, nav, settings) in a parent `layout.tsx` so it is not re-fetched on every page turn.
- Next.js maintains a prioritized prefetch queue: links in the viewport first, then links showing hover/touch intent, and links scrolled off-screen are discarded rather than queued forever. A book-detail page with hundreds of chapter links therefore will not thrash the network — but still avoid rendering a 1000-link catalog without virtualization.

### Scroll-triggered prefetch at 80% (implementation)

For the next chapter, trigger `router.prefetch()` when the reader reaches 80% of the current chapter content using `IntersectionObserver`:

```tsx
// src/components/ScrollPrefetch.tsx
'use client'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

interface Props {
  nextChapterHref: string | null
}

export function ScrollPrefetch({ nextChapterHref }: Props) {
  const router = useRouter()
  const sentinelRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const sentinel = sentinelRef.current
    if (!sentinel || !nextChapterHref) return

    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          router.prefetch(nextChapterHref)
          observer.disconnect() // prefetch once, stop watching
        }
      },
      { threshold: 0 }
    )
    observer.observe(sentinel)
    return () => observer.disconnect()
  }, [nextChapterHref, router])

  // Placed at 80% of the chapter content container (container must be position: relative)
  return (
    <div
      ref={sentinelRef}
      style={{ position: 'absolute', top: '80%', height: 1 }}
      aria-hidden="true"
    />
  )
}
```

Place `<ScrollPrefetch nextChapterHref={nextHref} />` inside the chapter content container.

### Disable prefetch on large chapter lists

If a book detail page shows all 50+ chapter links, prevent viewport-triggered prefetch from hitting the network for all of them simultaneously:

```tsx
// In the chapter list — disable auto-prefetch; hover intent will still trigger it
<Link href={chapterHref} prefetch={false}>
  {chapterTitle}
</Link>
```

### Side-effect isolation during prefetch

Do not put analytics events (pageview tracking, scroll depth) directly in page/layout components — they fire during prefetch, not just on actual navigation. Wrap them in `useEffect` inside a client component so they only run in the browser after the route actually renders.

---

## JavaScript Bundle

### App Router code splitting model

React Server Components (RSC) are automatically excluded from the browser JS bundle — they never ship JavaScript to the client. Only `'use client'` components are included. This means a chapter reader page with the navigation in RSC and only the theme toggle as a client component has a very small initial JS footprint.

**Bundle size targets:**

| Budget | Threshold | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Initial JS | < 150KB gzipped | Good; web.dev recommendation for 4G/3G mobile |
| Initial JS | < 200KB gzipped | Maximum acceptable |
| Total page weight | < 600KB | HTML + CSS + images + initial JS |
| Third-party scripts | ≤ 5 resources | GPT, AdSense, Pixel, Vercel SI, GA = 5 |

### Bundle analyzer setup

```bash
pnpm add -D @next/bundle-analyzer
```

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
})
module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({ /* existing config */ })
```

```bash
ANALYZE=true pnpm build
# Opens client.html, edge.html, nodejs.html — inspect the treemap for bloat
```

### Dynamic imports for non-critical client components

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Reader settings panel — only needed when user opens it
const ReaderSettings = dynamic(() => import('./ReaderSettings'), {
  ssr: false,  // excludes from SSR bundle; creates a separate JS chunk
  loading: () => <div className="h-32 animate-pulse bg-base-200 rounded" />,
})
```

`ssr: false` creates a separate JS chunk that only downloads when the component first renders, not on initial page load.

### Common bundle bloat sources

- **Lodash without tree-shaking**: import `{ debounce }` from `lodash-es`, not `import _ from 'lodash'`
- **Moment.js**: replace with `date-fns` or native `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- **Heavy icon libraries**: import individual SVGs, not an entire icon pack
- **DaisyUI**: CSS-only at runtime (zero JS), but Tailwind `content` config must be correct for purging
- **React runtime**: ~45KB gzipped — unavoidable; accept it as the baseline
- Defer any script that is not needed for first paint
- Do not load analytics, chat widgets, or ad scripts on a prototype unless the user explicitly asks

---

## CSS

- Inline critical above-the-fold CSS (reader background, font size, body text color).
- Tailwind: configure `content` paths correctly to eliminate unused utility classes.
- Reader theme switching must use DaisyUI `data-theme` value updates, not class-swap-triggered reflows.
- Avoid layout-triggering animations (avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`). Use `transform` and `opacity` only.

---

## Caching

### Static asset cache headers

```json
// vercel.json — covers and illustrations are content-addressed, cache 1 year
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(covers|illustrations)/(.*)",
      "headers": [{ "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" }]
    },
    {
      "source": "/_next/static/(.*)",
      "headers": [{ "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### HTML page cache

```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400
```

SSG HTML files are safe to cache for 1 hour (3600s) with a 24-hour stale-while-revalidate window. Vercel sets this automatically for SSG pages.

### Client-side prefetch cache

Next.js App Router caches prefetched pages client-side for ~5 minutes. Chapter navigation reuses this cache — no network request on prev/next within a 5-minute reading session.

## Real User Monitoring

### web-vitals library

```bash
pnpm add web-vitals
```

Use the attribution build to get element-level debug data:

```typescript
// src/lib/vitals.ts
import { onCLS, onINP, onLCP } from 'web-vitals/attribution'

function sendVital(metric: Parameters<Parameters<typeof onLCP>[0]>[0]) {
  const body = JSON.stringify({
    name: metric.name,
    value: metric.value,
    rating: metric.rating,  // 'good' | 'needs-improvement' | 'poor'
    delta: metric.delta,
    id: metric.id,
    attribution: metric.attribution,
    page: location.pathname,
  })
  // sendBeacon is non-blocking — fires on page hide without delaying navigation
  navigator.sendBeacon('/api/vitals', body)
}

export function initVitals() {
  onLCP(sendVital)
  onINP(sendVital)
  onCLS(sendVital)
}
```

### Key attribution fields for fiction site debugging

| Metric | Useful attribution fields | What they reveal |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | `target`, `url`, `timeToFirstByte`, `resourceLoadDelay`, `resourceLoadDuration`, `elementRenderDelay` | Which cover image is slow; is it TTFB or image fetch? |
| INP | `inputDelay`, `processingDuration`, `presentationDelay`, `interactionTarget`, `longAnimationFrameEntries` | Which element caused poor INP; is it ad scripts (input delay) or handler code (processing)? |
| CLS | `largestShiftTarget`, `largestShiftValue` | Which element shifted; usually an ad slot div |

If `interactionTarget` for a poor INP interaction points to an ad slot div → fix: `scheduler.yield()` in ad initialization. If it points to a chapter navigation button → fix: reduce React re-renders in the reader.

### Vercel Speed Insights vs. web-vitals library

| | Vercel Speed Insights | web-vitals library |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Zero-config component | Custom reporting endpoint |
| Data | p75 per route in Vercel dashboard | Full distribution + attribution |
| GDPR | No cookies, no cross-site | No cookies, no cross-site |
| Use for | Trend monitoring, regression alerts | Root-cause investigation |

Use both: Speed Insights for monitoring, web-vitals for debugging regressions.

## Performance Budgets & CI Enforcement

### Lighthouse CI

```bash
pnpm add -D @lhci/cli
```

**`lighthouserc.js`** at the project root:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      staticDistDir: './out',  // for output: 'export' sites
      // For Vercel deployment: use startServerCommand + url instead
      numberOfRuns: 3,         // median of 3 runs for stable scores
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {

**GitHub Actions workflow:**

```yaml
name: Lighthouse CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lhci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: pnpm install && pnpm build
      - run: pnpm dlx @lhci/cli autorun
        env:
          LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
```

### Bundle size CI with `size-limit`

```bash
pnpm add -D @size-limit/preset-app size-limit
```

```json
// package.json
"size-limit": [
  { "path": ".next/static/chunks/main-*.js", "limit": "50 KB", "gzip": true },
  { "path": ".next/static/chunks/pages/_app-*.js", "limit": "80 KB", "gzip": true }
],
"scripts": {
  "size": "size-limit"
}
```

Add `pnpm size` to the CI pipeline after the build step. Fails the build if a PR inflates a chunk past budget.

## Offline / PWA

Implement a Service Worker only if the user asks for PWA or offline reading support.

When implementing:
- Cache the site shell (HTML, CSS, core JS) on install.
- Cache visited chapters on fetch, using a cache-first strategy for chapter content.
- Cache the home page and last-visited book detail.
- Show an offline fallback page for uncached routes.
- Do not cache chapter content speculatively (pre-cache the whole book) unless the user asks — it wastes mobile data.

## Vercel Deployment Checklist

Five standards every fiction site deployed to Vercel must satisfy before going live.

### 1. sitemap.ts + robots.ts

Use Next.js App Router's native metadata route files — no third-party package needed.

Place both files directly under `src/app/`:

**`src/app/sitemap.ts`** — imports the books array, generates URLs for every book detail page and every chapter page. All URLs end with `/` (matches `trailingSlash: true` in next.config):

```ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next'
import { books } from '@/lib/books'

export default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {
  const base = 'https://your-domain.com'
  const staticPages: MetadataRoute.Sitemap = [
    { url: base + '/', changeFrequency: 'weekly', priority: 1.0 },
    { url: base + '/about/', changeFrequency: 'yearly', priority: 0.3 },
    { url: base + '/privacy/', changeFrequency: 'yearly', priority: 0.2 },
    { url: base + '/terms/', changeFrequency: 'yearly', priority: 0.2 },
    { url: base + '/contact/', changeFrequency: 'yearly', priority: 0.2 },
  ]
  const bookPages: MetadataRoute.Sitemap = books.flatMap(book => [
    { url: `${base}/book/${book.slug}/`, changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const, priority: 0.8 },
    ...Array.from({ length: book.chapterCount }, (_, i) => ({
      url: `${base}/book/${book.slug}/chapter/${i + 1}/`,
      changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const,
      priority: 0.6,
    })),
  ])
  return [...staticPages, ...bookPages]
}
```

**`src/app/robots.ts`** — points search engines at `/sitemap.xml`:

```ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next'

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: { userAgent: '*', allow: '/' },
    sitemap: 'https://your-domain.com/sitemap.xml',
  }
}
```

Both files are automatically served at `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` by the framework — no `next.config` change required.

### 2. vercel.json Cache Headers + Security

**`vercel.json`** at the project root:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(covers|illustrations)/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/covers/:file.json", "destination": "/___blocked___" },
    { "source": "/illustrations/:book/:file.json", "destination": "/___blocked___" }
  ]
}
```

**Cache headers**: covers and illustrations are content-addressed and never change after upload — one combined pattern caches both at the CDN edge for one year, eliminating origin bandwidth on repeat visits.

**Rewrites (security)**: each image generation also produces a `.json` sidecar that contains the full AI prompt. Rewriting `.json` requests to a non-existent path causes Vercel to return a natural 404, blocking prompt exposure without affecting image delivery. The two patterns cover the flat cover structure (`/covers/{slug}.json`) and the nested illustration structure (`/illustrations/{book}/{file}.json`).

### 3. CookieBanner

Each site needs its own cookie-consent banner with a site-specific localStorage key so consent state is isolated per domain. Choose the variant based on the site's primary market:

| Variant | When to use | Key format |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Basic** | Non-EU/UK markets (US, LatAm, etc.) — Reject + Accept buttons | `{prefix}-cookie-consent` |
| **GDPR** | EU / UK markets — Accept All / Reject All / Manage categories | `{prefix}-cookie-consent-v2` |

Key prefix convention: two-letter abbreviation of the site slug (e.g. `vt` for velvet-throne, `mf` for midnight-fable, `fe` for fuego-eterno, `lp` for london-pages, `wr` for wildfire-reads).

Both variants are **UI-only** — they record user preference in localStorage but do not gate or alter ad loading. The banner satisfies notice requirements; actual ad personalisation is governed by the ad network.

---

**Variant A — Basic** (non-EU/UK markets):

Adapt text to the site language. English template: `"{Site Name} uses cookies to personalise content and ads."` Spanish template: `"{Nombre} utiliza cookies para personalizar contenido y anuncios."`

Provide both **Reject** and **Accept** buttons. Rejecting does not block ads — it only records the preference and dismisses the banner.

```tsx
'use client'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

const CONSENT_KEY = '{prefix}-cookie-consent'

export default function CookieBanner() {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      if (!localStorage.getItem(CONSENT_KEY)) setVisible(true)
    } catch { setVisible(true) }
  }, [])

  if (!visible) return null

  function accept() {
    try { localStorage.setItem(CONSENT_KEY, '1') } catch {}
    setVisible(false)
  }

  function reject() {
    try { localStorage.setItem(CONSENT_KEY, '0') } catch {}
    setVisible(false)
  }

  return (
    <div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-[9999] bg-base-200 border-t border-base-300 shadow-lg px-4 py-3 flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-3">
      <p className="text-sm text-base-content flex-1 text-center sm:text-left">
        {/* EN: "{Site Name} uses cookies to personalise content and ads." */}
        {/* ES: "{Nombre} utiliza cookies para personalizar contenido y anuncios." */}
        {'{Site Name}'} uses cookies to personalise content and ads.{' '}
        <Link href="/privacy" className="underline hover:text-primary">Learn more</Link>
      </p>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 shrink-0">
        <button
          onClick={reject}
          className="px-4 py-2 rounded text-sm font-medium border border-base-300 hover:border-primary hover:text-primary transition-colors"
        >
          {/* EN: Reject  ES: Rechazar */}
          Reject
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={accept}
          className="bg-primary text-primary-content px-4 py-2 rounded text-sm font-medium hover:opacity-90 transition-opacity"
        >
          {/* EN: Accept  ES: Aceptar */}
          Accept
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

**Variant B — GDPR** (EU / UK markets):

Three-button layout (Accept All / Reject All / Manage) with a category panel. Stores structured JSON so categories can be read later. The `v2` suffix in the key intentionally invalidates any legacy `v1` consent stored by an older Basic banner on the same domain.

```tsx
'use client'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

type ConsentData = { analytics: boolean; advertising: boolean }

const KEY = '{prefix}-cookie-consent-v2'

function saveConsent(c: ConsentData) {
  try { localStorage.setItem(KEY, JSON.stringify(c)) } catch {}
}

export default function CookieBanner() {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false)
  const [managing, setManaging] = useState(false)
  const [analytics, setAnalytics] = useState(false)
  const [advertising, setAdvertising] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      if (!localStorage.getItem(KEY)) setVisible(true)
    } catch { setVisible(true) }
  }, [])

  if (!visible) return null

  return (
    <div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-[9999] bg-base-200 border-t border-base-300 shadow-lg">
      {!managing ? (

          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

Import and render `<CookieBanner />` at the end of `<body>` in `src/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import CookieBanner from '@/components/CookieBanner'
// ...
<body>
  {children}
  <CookieBanner />
</body>
```

### 4. OG Image

Three-layer requirement. Every layer must be covered before launch:

| Layer | Where | Image | URL form |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Homepage** | `layout.tsx` openGraph | `logo.png` (512×512) | Absolute (`https://`) |
| **Book detail** | `book/[slug]/page.tsx` generateMetadata | `book.cover` (848×1280) | Relative OK — resolved by `metadataBase` |
| **Chapter** | `book/[slug]/chapter/[n]/page.tsx` generateMetadata | `book.cover` (848×1280) | Relative OK — resolved by `metadataBase` |

**`metadataBase` is the key**: set it once in `layout.tsx` with the real domain, and all relative OG image URLs in child pages resolve to absolute automatically. No `siteUrl` env var needed.

**`src/app/layout.tsx`** — homepage fallback (logo, absolute URL):

```ts
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL('https://your-domain.com'),  // hardcode real domain
  openGraph: {
    siteName: 'Your Site Name',
    type: 'website',
    images: [{ url: 'https://your-domain.com/logo.png', width: 512, height: 512, alt: 'Your Site Name' }],
  },
}
```

**`src/app/book/[slug]/page.tsx`** and **`src/app/book/[slug]/chapter/[n]/page.tsx`** — book cover (relative path resolved by metadataBase):

```ts
openGraph: {
  title: book.title,
  description: book.description,
  images: [{ url: book.cover, width: 848, height: 1280, alt: book.title }],
  type: 'book',  // or 'article' for chapter pages
  siteName: 'Your Site Name',
},
twitter: { card: 'summary_large_image' },
```

**Chapter page without explicit OG image** is acceptable — Next.js falls back to the root layout's `logo.png`. But setting `book.cover` on chapter pages is preferred for better FB/Twitter previews.

Rules:
- `logo.png` must exist at `public/logo.png`. Dimensions: 512×512 minimum, square is safe for all platforms.
- `book.cover` is `/covers/{slug}.webp` — a relative path. With `metadataBase` set, Next.js outputs an absolute URL in the built HTML. Verify by grepping `og:image` in `out/` after build.
- The book cover (portrait 2:3, 848×1280) doubles as the FB link preview for book and chapter pages — no separate OG image asset needed.

### 5. Speed Insights + Analytics

Vercel Analytics tracks page views and visitor trends. It is GDPR-friendly (no cookies, no cross-site tracking) and complements GA4 rather than replace it. Vercel Speed Insights is reserved for the primary paid-traffic test site (`midnight-fable`) because adding a domain to a Vercel project for Speed Insights can incur billing on non-Pro plans. New sites should wire Analytics only unless the user explicitly asks for Speed Insights.

**Install Analytics only (default):**

```bash
pnpm add @vercel/analytics
```

**`src/app/layout.tsx`** — import and render `Analytics` inside `<body>`:

```tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'
// ...
<body>
  {children}
  <CookieBanner />
  <Analytics />
</body>
```

The component injects a minimal script that runs after the page is interactive — it does not block first paint or affect LCP.

**Speed Insights (optional, only when explicitly requested):**

If the user asks for Speed Insights on a specific site, install and import it separately:

```bash
pnpm add @vercel/speed-insights
```

```tsx
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
// ...
<body>
  {children}
  <CookieBanner />
  <SpeedInsights />
  <Analytics />
</body>
```

## Pitfall: Internal npm Registry in pnpm Lockfile

If the development machine has a corporate or internal npm registry set as the global pnpm registry (e.g. Alibaba's `registry.npm.alibaba-inc.com`), pnpm bakes the registry's tarball URLs into `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Vercel's CI cannot reach an internal network and the build fails with `ERR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT` when fetching packages.

**Symptom**: Vercel build log shows errors like:
```
WARN GET https://registry.anpm.alibaba-inc.com/@vercel/analytics/-/analytics-x.x.x.tgz
ERR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT ... Socket timeout
Error: Command "pnpm install" exited with 1
```

**Fix**: add a project-level `.npmrc` at the site root to override the global registry, then regenerate the lockfile:

```ini
# .npmrc
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

```bash
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
```

The `--registry` flag is required because pnpm's own global config (`pnpm config set registry`) takes precedence over `.npmrc`; passing it on the CLI overrides everything. Commit both `.npmrc` and the regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml`. The lockfile should contain only `integrity` hashes, not `tarball` URLs pointing to the internal host.
