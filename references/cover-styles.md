# Cover Styles

Reference for `story-cover.md`. Genre-to-visual-style mapping for cover image generation prompts.

## Site-Level Style Decision

**Before generating any covers, determine the site's primary visual register.** All books on the same site use the same render style — do not mix styles across books unless the site explicitly mixes genres (e.g. a general fiction platform).

| Site theme | Visual register | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Cinematic Drama** | AI film-still quality, photorealistic real actors, high contrast, emotion-first composition | Site hosts Urban Drama / Contemporary Romance / Thriller / Historical Court Drama content — contemporary or historical drama where characters feel human and real |
| **Dark Fantasy Illustration** | Hyperrealistic 3D render, near-black atmospheric background, gold/silver metallic typography, epic world elements | Site hosts Cultivation Fantasy / Dark Fantasy / Sci-Fi content — power systems, fantasy worlds, sci-fi |
| **British Literary** | Painterly period photography or fine-art editorial, warm muted tones and compositional restraint — understated rather than dramatic | Site hosts Regency / Historical / Cosy Mystery / Gothic / Literary Thriller — British-flavoured, period-grounded, atmosphere-first rather than power-first |
| **Emotional Drama** | Desaturated editorial photography, cold-warm contrast, threshold and outsider framing — quiet emotional weight rather than kinetic drama | Site hosts Family Drama / Secret Identity / Medical Drama / Grief Fiction — contemporary emotional fiction where the visual subject is an interior state, not an action |

Determine which register fits the site during **Phase 6 (Design plan)** and record it in the design-system notes. All Phase 3 cover generation for that site uses the same register.

If the site mixes genres, default to **Cinematic Drama** for realism-leaning titles and **Dark Fantasy Illustration** for genre-fantasy titles, but keep color palettes harmonized across covers so the homepage grid feels cohesive.

## Visual Style Standard

Both registers target **photorealistic or hyperrealistic 3D render quality** — not painted, not anime, not watercolor. The reference aesthetic is:

- **Cinematic Drama** (Urban Drama / Contemporary Romance / Thriller / Historical Court Drama): AI-generated film-still quality. Characters look like real actors in a directed scene. High contrast, shallow depth of field, emotion-first composition. Think: prestige drama movie poster or streaming series thumbnail.
- **Dark Fantasy Illustration** (Cultivation Fantasy / Dark Fantasy / Sci-Fi): Hyperrealistic 3D render, dark gradient background (deep black → navy/purple), character in detailed fantasy or sci-fi attire, dramatic atmospheric lighting. Gold/silver/chrome metallic typography is large and dominant in the lower 35% of the frame.
- **British Literary** (Regency / Historical / Cosy Mystery / Gothic / Literary Thriller): Painterly period photography or fine-art editorial quality. Warm cream, muted sage, deep burgundy or charcoal palettes depending on sub-genre. Atmosphere and period detail are the primary subjects; characters are composed and restrained rather than dramatic. Think: BBC period drama production still, literary fiction hardcover jacket.
- **Emotional Drama** (Family Drama / Secret Identity / Medical Drama / Grief Fiction): Desaturated or cool-muted editorial photography. Cold-to-warm contrast (grey institutional exterior → warm lamp interior visible through glass). The composition is about threshold, distance, and witness — where characters stand in relation to each other and to spaces that carry their claim. Zero allure. Think: quiet literary fiction cover or long-form magazine photography, not a movie poster.

**Shared quality keywords (include in every prompt):**
`photorealistic, ultra-detailed, cinematic lighting, 8K render, professional book cover, shallow depth of field, dramatic atmosphere`

## Composition Templates

Pick the template that best matches the book's core tension. These mirror the reference visual language.

| Template | When to use | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Power Inversion** | Urban Drama / Contemporary Romance revenge, humiliation, domination arcs | **TWO characters.** One standing figure (powerful, cold, composed) looks down at a kneeling/crying/bound figure. Third character optional as witness. Setting: luxury interior, parking garage, ballroom. |
| **Intimate Tension** | Contemporary Romance / Urban Drama romance, billionaire arcs | **TWO characters.** Two figures in close proximity — woman wrapped in white bed sheet with bare shoulders and legs visible to mid-thigh, clutching sheet to chest, expression of shock or conflict; man in open-collar shirt at rest on rumpled bed watching her. Luxury penthouse bedroom, floor-to-ceiling cityscape windows. Foreground props: champagne flute, scattered luxury items (jewelry, lipstick). |
| **Rain Shelter** | Thriller / Contemporary Romance dark romance, protection arcs | **TWO characters.** Two figures on a wet night street, one holding a black umbrella over the other. The protected figure looks downcast; the protector looks stern or conflicted. City lights reflect on the wet pavement. Setting can be European street or neon city. |
| **Grand Humiliation** | Contemporary Romance / Urban Drama gala/elite society arcs | **TWO characters.** Glamorous dominant figure in deep-V plunging neckline floor-length gown (thigh-high slit, jeweled décolletage, red lips, chandelier jewels) stands elevated or turns away in contempt while a male figure kneels or collapses crying at her feet. Grand ballroom setting: chandeliers, champagne tower, roses, crowd of onlookers. |
| **Lone Hero** | Cultivation Fantasy / Sci-Fi / Historical War Epic | **ONE character.** Single powerful protagonist fills center-left frame, facing slightly away from camera. Epic world behind: ruined city + energy portal (sci-fi), snowy mountains + dark castle (fantasy), cloud sea + ancient pagodas (cultivation). Title in large metallic font occupies lower 35% of frame. |
| **Duo Confrontation** | Dark Fantasy / Historical Court Drama romance + power | **TWO characters.** Two characters pressed together — powerful male behind or beside protected female. Dark dramatic background. Matching detailed costumes. Both look into distance or at camera with intensity. |
| **Manor Portrait** | Regency / Historical Mystery | **ONE character.** Female figure in period dress (empire waist or Victorian) at estate exterior or formal garden; grand manor or gothic house behind her; soft atmospheric mist or golden afternoon light. Expression composed but with tension in the eyes. |
| **The Parlour Secret** | Cosy Mystery / Historical Mystery | **ONE character + props.** Woman at writing desk or armchair; period tea service visible; sealed letter, medicine bottle, or hidden key prominent in foreground; expression knowing or alarmed; warm afternoon window light or candlelight. |
| **Moors at Dusk** | Gothic / Gothic Romance | **ONE character / landscape dominant.** Solitary female silhouette small against windswept moors, ruined abbey battlements, or cliff edge; dramatic sky (storm clouds, pale moon, rolling fog); figure is emotionally isolated against scale of landscape. |
| **Cold Evidence** | Literary Thriller | **ONE character + object.** Subject holds or faces a single charged object (sealed document, decoded letter, photograph, key); near-minimalist background; chiaroscuro; expression unreadable or calculating. |
| **The Threshold** | Family Drama / Medical Drama / Secret Identity | **ONE character.** Figure stands at a doorway, corridor end, or entrance — not yet inside, not outside either. Hospital entrance, family home doorstep, the door of a room she is not supposed to enter. Expression carries the weight of what is on the other side. Desaturated exterior, warm interior light visible through the frame. |
| **Witnessed Distance** | Grief Fiction / Family Drama | **TWO characters** who are not connecting. Both in frame but not touching, not making eye contact — each looking at something the other cannot see or share. The space between them is the visual subject. Muted palette; natural light; no drama of pose. |

- **Lighting:** `cool diffuse hospital fluorescent with warm amber lamp glow visible in background, window light that doesn't quite reach the figure, morning light through glass that reveals rather than glamorizes`
- **Composition:** The Threshold template (solo figure at a doorway, cold exterior / warm interior contrast) or Witnessed Distance template (two figures in the same frame, not connecting, space between them is the subject); title in quiet text-weight serif, no ornament
