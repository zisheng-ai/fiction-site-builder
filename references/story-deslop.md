# Story & Copy Deslop

Load this reference when removing AI flavor from prose — fiction chapters, traffic articles, taglines, synopses, or site copy.

Run deslop periodically on full books:
- After finishing all chapters of a new book, following the write and review passes.
- During bulk maintenance of existing books.

## Content Type Router

| Content | Gates to run | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Fiction chapters | All 7 Gates + Three-Pass Method | Full pipeline |
| Traffic articles | A, B, C (passive + vague), G, H + Article Quick Checks | No E/F (no dialogue/endings) |
| Taglines / synopses | A (adverbs + jargon), B (binary contrasts + throat-clearing), G (false agency), H (stakes inflation + concept labels) | Minimal pass, surgical |
| Meta descriptions | B (throat-clearing), G (false agency), Article Quick Checks | <155 chars, one active sentence |

---

## Core Philosophy

AI flavor is not a grammar error — it is a style problem: over-polished, symmetrical, over-explained. The goal is to pull text from over-crafted back toward specific, natural, readable. Change the minimum amount to shift the character of the passage.

**Never delete entire paragraphs.** Plot function, foreshadow, character reveals, and tension hooks must survive. If a passage is bad, rewrite it — don't erase it.

For copy (articles, taglines): same principle — minimum effective change. Don't rewrite voice, rewrite violations.

## Detection: The 7 Gates + Gate H

Run the applicable gates based on content type (see router above) and severity (see Severity Levels below).

| Gate | Problem | Signal |
|------|---------|--------|
| A | Banned words / high-frequency clichés / adverbs / jargon | Fiction: "something flickered in his eyes" "he drew a deep breath"; Copy: adverbs (-ly), filler phrases ("At its core"), business jargon, AI vocabulary tells |
| B | Template sentence patterns | negation-then-reversal, binary contrasts, consecutive parallel ≥3, throat-clearing openers, dramatic fragmentation, meta-commentary, self-posed Q&A, anaphora, superficial analyses |
| C | Telling not showing / passive voice / vague declaratives | "he felt" / "X was created" / "The implications are significant" |
| D | Uniform rhythm / paragraph length / formatting | Every paragraph 4–6 sentences, identical beat; bold-first bullets; em dashes; listicle-as-prose |
| E | Flat dialogue tags *(fiction only)* | "said/asked/smiled" on nearly every line |
| F | Moral summary endings *(fiction only)* | Last paragraph summarizes or moralizes what just happened |
| G | Narrator intrusion / false agency / narrator-from-a-distance / vague attributions | "What she didn't know was..." / "the decision emerges" / "Nobody designed this." / "Experts argue..." |
| H | Composition & tone tropes *(articles + copy)* | False vulnerability, grandiose stakes, invented concept labels, fractal summaries, dead metaphor, one-point dilution |

---

## Severity Levels

*(Fiction chapters — for copy, run gates directly without severity scoring)*

| Level | Quantity signal | Gates to run |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Mild | ≤5 banned words/1,000 chars, no consecutive 3+ templates | A + B |
| Moderate | 6–15 banned words/1,000 chars, or 3+ consecutive templates | A + B + C + D + G |
| Severe | >15 banned words/1,000 chars, or 4+ of the 7 Gates flagged | All 7 Gates + targeted rewrites |

Deletion cap by severity: Mild ≤15%, Moderate ≤25%, Severe ≤35% of the passage. Mark anything borderline `[NEEDS REVIEW]` rather than deleting.

---

## Structural Anchors — Never Touch

These elements must survive every deslop pass unchanged:

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Frontmatter fields (`title`, `chapter`, `bookId`, `language`, `status`) | Build system and URL routing depend on these |
| Chapter H1 heading (the first `# ` line after frontmatter) | Reader UI renders this as chapter title |
| `<!-- ILLUSTRATION -->` markers | Illustration injection point — moving breaks layout |
| Internal links (`href="/book/..."`) | Any path change breaks navigation |
| File names (`ch-NNN-slug.md`) | Static params generated from filenames |

**Rule**: deslop operates only on prose body lines. It never modifies frontmatter, headings, markers, links, or filenames — even if those contain AI-flavored phrasing.

---

## Gate A — Banned Words / Adverbs / Jargon

### Fiction clichés

| AI-flavored phrase | Natural alternative |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| he drew a deep breath | his chest rose / delete |
| something flickered in his eyes | he looked away / narrowed his eyes |
| the corner of his mouth curved | he smiled — it didn't reach his eyes / he laughed |
| as if / as though / as though woven from | plain comparison or literal description |
| couldn't help but | direct action verb |
| slowly opened his mouth | just use dialogue / action-then-dialogue |
| something in his/her chest | name the specific physical sensation or delete |
| exhale/inhale like [simile] | delete the action tag entirely, go to dialogue or next beat |

### Adverbs — kill on sight

No -ly words. No softeners, no intensifiers, no hedges.

Offenders: really, just, literally, genuinely, honestly, simply, actually, deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, inevitably, interestingly, importantly, crucially, quietly, certainly, arguably, remarkably, notably, surprisingly.

**"Quietly" as magic adverb:** AI reaches for "quietly" to convey subtle importance — "quietly orchestrating workflows", "a quiet intelligence behind it." It's not actually subtle; it's decorative. Delete.

### AI vocabulary tells

Words overrepresented in AI-generated text. Flag on sight.

| Word | Why | Replace with |
|------|-----|--------------|
| delve | no human writes "let's delve" | examine, look at, explore |
| tapestry | lazy metaphor for anything complex | mix, combination, range |
| nuanced | used instead of being nuanced | complex, specific |
| certainly | hedging that sounds confident | rewrite with evidence, or cut |
| curated | overused for "selected" | selected, chosen, collected |
| foster | bureaucratic verb | build, create, encourage |
| ecosystem | grandiose replacement for "community" or "system" | system, field, community |
| paradigm | sounds academic, means nothing specific | model, approach |
| synergy | never use | cooperation, combined effect |
| framework | overused | structure, approach |

**False ranges:** "From X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a real spectrum — "from startups to enterprises," "from innovation to cultural transformation." They list examples, not a range. State the examples directly.

### The "serves as" dodge

AI replaces "is" with pompous alternatives. Use the simple verb.

| Avoid | Use instead |
|-------|-------------|
| serves as | is |
| stands as | is |
| marks (when meaning "is") | is |
| represents (when meaning "is") | is |

### Business jargon → plain language

| Avoid | Use instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Navigate (challenges) | Handle, address |
| Unpack (analysis) | Explain, examine |
| Lean into | Accept, embrace |
| Landscape (context) | Situation, field |
| Game-changer | Replace with the specific impact |
| Deep dive | Analysis, examination |
| Moving forward | Next, from now |
| Circle back | Return to, revisit |
| Understands the assignment | Replace with the actual premise |
| Leverage (verb) | Use |
| Utilize | Use |
| Robust | Strong, solid |
| Streamline | Simplify |
| Harness | Use, apply |
| Double down | Commit, increase |
| Take a step back | Reconsider |
| On the same page | Aligned, agreed |
| Unpack | Explain |
| Holistic | Complete, full |
| Cutting-edge | New, recent |
| Groundbreaking | New, first |
| Transformative | Significant (if it's actually significant) |

### Paired adjectives with "yet" / "and"

"Simple yet powerful", "elegant and robust", "lightweight but comprehensive." Pick the stronger adjective. Drop the pairing.

### Scare quotes

Quotation marks used for irony or emphasis around ordinary words — not actual quotations. "The tool 'seamlessly' integrates..." Choose a better word and drop the quotes.

### Internet clichés

Phrases that were once online-native, now overused by AI as if they're still fresh.

| Cut | Replace with |
|-----|-------------|
| "you can't unsee it" | say what you now see |
| "hits different" | say how it differs |
| "rent-free" | say it occupies your attention |
| "chef's kiss" | say what makes it right |
| "the quiet part out loud" | say what was implied |
| "let that sink in" | delete |
| "say it louder for the people in the back" | delete |
| "I'm here for it" | delete or commit to a specific opinion |

---

## Gate B — Template Sentence Patterns

Gate B structural patterns appear in ~2/3 of AI-generated chapters and are more endemic than Gate A word-level clichés. Scan for these first.

### 1. Negation-reversal / Binary contrasts (most common — ~65% of chapters)

The writer states what something is NOT before stating what it IS. State Y directly. Drop the negation entirely.

```
Flagged:  "Not defensive. Flat."
Flagged:  "No X. No Y. Just Z."
Flagged:  "Not because X. Because Y."
Flagged:  "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is."
Flagged:  "The answer isn't X. It's Y."
Flagged:  "not X, it's Y" / "isn't X, it's Y"
Flagged:  "not just X but also Y"
Flagged:  "It feels like X. It's actually Y."
Flagged:  "The question isn't X. It's Y."
Flagged:  "It's not this. It's that."
Flagged:  "stops being X and starts being Y"
Flagged:  "doesn't mean X, but actually Y"
Flagged:  "less about X, more about Y"
Rewrite:  Collapse into one direct statement.
Example:  "Not defensive. Flat." → "Flat."
Example:  "No grief, no shock. Just calculation." → "Pure calculation."
Example:  "The tension isn't whether they'll fall. It's whether she'll understand." → "The question is whether she'll understand."
```

### 2. Consecutive same-structure sentences (≥3 in a row)

Any subject-verb pattern repeated three or more consecutive times, regardless of vocabulary variation.

```
Flagged:  She'd done this. She'd seen that. She'd known better.
Flagged:  He left. He came back. He said nothing.
Flagged:  Then she stood. Then she turned. Then she opened the door.
Fix:      Vary the third sentence's structure — subordinate clause, question, or restructure.
```

### 3. Passive reflection blocks ("had always") *(fiction)*

```
Flagged:  "She had always found silence uncomfortable."
Fix:      Cut "had always" and put the character into an active moment that shows the same trait.
Example:  → "The silence went on long enough that she started counting floor tiles."
```

### 4. Throat-clearing openers *(copy)*

Remove these; state the content directly.

```
Flagged:  "Here's the thing:" / "Here's what [X]" / "Here's why [X]"
Flagged:  "The uncomfortable truth is" / "The real [X] is"
Flagged:  "It turns out" / "Let me be clear" / "The truth is,"
Flagged:  "I'm going to be honest" / "Can we talk about"
Flagged:  "If you've been looking for X" / "If you came here for X but"
Flagged:  "Here's the kicker" / "Here's where it gets interesting"
Flagged:  "Here's what most people miss" / "Here's the deal"
Flagged:  "I'll say it again:" / "Here's what I find interesting"
Flagged:  "The truth is simple" / "History is unambiguous on this point"
Flagged:  "We're excited to announce..." / "I'm thrilled to share..."
Flagged:  "Look:" / "So here's what happened:"
Fix:      State the point. Cut everything before it.
```

### 4a. Pedagogical hand-holding *(copy)*

AI defaults to teacher mode and assumes the reader needs hand-holding. Cut these.

```
Flagged:  "Let's break this down" / "Let's unpack this" / "Let's explore"
Flagged:  "Let's dive in" / "Let's delve into"
Flagged:  "Think of it as..." / "Think of it like..."
Flagged:  "Imagine a world where..."
Flagged:  "Whether you're X or Y..." (false inclusivity; pick the actual audience)
Fix:      Delete. Start with the substance.
```

### 5. Dramatic fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

```
Flagged:  "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]."
Flagged:  "The mark. The debt. The clause." (three separate fragments)
Flagged:  "This unlocks something. [Word]."
Flagged:  "X. And Y. And Z." (staccato drama)
Flagged:  "He published this. Openly. In a book." (fragment stacking)
Flagged:  "Platforms do." (orphaned fragment as punchline)
Fix:      Complete sentences, or combine: "The mark, the debt, the clause."
```

### 6. Meta-commentary *(copy)*

Remove self-referential asides. Let the piece move.

```
Flagged:  "The rest of this essay explains..."
Flagged:  "Let me walk you through..." / "In this section, we'll..."
Flagged:  "But that's another post"
Flagged:  "As we discussed above..." / "As mentioned earlier..."
Fix:      Delete. Start the next point.
```

### 7. Rhetorical setups

```
Flagged:  "What if [reframe]?" answered immediately
Flagged:  "Think about it:" / "Here's what I mean:"
Fix:      Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.
```

### 8. Self-posed rhetorical Q&A *(copy — highest priority after type 1)*

The model asks a question nobody was asking, then answers it immediately for dramatic effect.

```
Flagged:  "The result? Devastating."
Flagged:  "The worst part? Nobody saw it coming."
Flagged:  "The scary part? This attack vector is perfect."
Flagged:  "And that's okay." (unnecessary permission-granting)
Fix:      Merge into a direct statement. "The result was devastating."
```

### 9. Anaphora abuse *(copy)*

Repeating the same sentence opening multiple times in quick succession.

```
Flagged:  "They assume that users will pay... They assume that developers will build... They assume that..."
Flagged:  "They could expose... They could offer... They could provide... They could create..."
Fix:      Vary openings. Combine related points into single sentences.
```

### 10. Superficial participle analysis

Tacking a present participle phrase onto a sentence to inject shallow significance. The -ing phrase adds the appearance of analysis without the content.

```
Flagged:  "contributing to the region's rich cultural heritage"
Flagged:  "highlighting its enduring importance"
Flagged:  "reflecting broader trends in the industry"
Flagged:  "underscoring its role as a dynamic hub"
Fix:      Cut the phrase entirely, or rewrite as a specific claim.
```

### 11. Repetitive "you" sentence starters *(copy)*

```
Flagged:  3+ consecutive sentences beginning with "You"
Fix:      Vary sentence structure — lead with the action, result, or situation.
```

---

## Gate C — Telling / Passive Voice / Vague Declaratives

### Telling not showing *(fiction)*

```
Flagged:  "he felt" / "she realized" / "emotion surged inside her"
Fix:      Ground in body action. "His hands shook." not "He was terrified."
```

### Passive voice *(all content)*

Every sentence needs a subject doing something. Passive voice hides the actor.

```
Flagged:  "X was created" → Name who created it.
Flagged:  "It is believed that" → Name who believes it.
Flagged:  "The decision was reached" → Name who decided.
Flagged:  "Mistakes were made" → Name who made them.
```

### Vague declaratives *(copy)*

Sentences that announce importance without naming the specific thing.

```
Flagged:  "The reasons are structural"
Flagged:  "The implications are significant"
Flagged:  "The stakes are high"
Fix:      Name the specific thing. If you can't, cut the sentence.
```

---

## Gate D — Uniform Rhythm / Paragraph Length / Formatting *(fiction + articles)*

| Natural | AI-flavored |
|---------|-------------|
| 1–3 sentences; occasional 1-sentence standalone | 4–6 sentences, uniform |
| Mix of short and long | Metronomic |
| Two-item lists | Three-item lists as default |
| Paragraphs ending differently | Every paragraph ends punchily |
| No em dashes | Em dashes everywhere |

**Em dash rule:** Remove all em dashes. Use a comma, period, or restructure the sentence.

**Three-item list rule:** Two items beat three. One item beats two when the point is singular.

**Sentence length uniformity check:** Four or more consecutive sentences all within 30% of their mean word count is an AI pattern. Real writing varies. Mix short and long; a 3-word sentence after a complex one creates rhythm.

**Bold-first bullets:** Every bullet starting with a bolded phrase is an AI formatting tell — almost no human writes lists this way by hand. In prose: write the key point into the sentence. In actual lists: keep the bolded keyword only if it's genuinely a label, not decoration.

**Unicode decoration:** → arrows, → bullets, decorative symbols (→, ◆, ★) in body prose. Use plain punctuation. "Input → Processing → Output" should be "input, processing, then output" or just a plain list.

**Listicle in trench coat:** Numbered paragraphs dressed as prose — "The first wall is... The second wall is... The third wall is..." That's a list. Either write genuine prose (combine points, develop them) or make it an explicit list. Don't disguise one as the other.

**Exclamation mark clusters:** More than one exclamation mark per paragraph, or more than three in the full document. Cut all but the one that matters most.

---

## Gate E — Flat Dialogue Tags *(fiction only)*

| Natural web fiction | AI-flavored text |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 60%+ tagless, action-attributed | Nearly every line tagged |
| Varied beats | "said/asked/smiled" on every line |

---

## Gate F — Moral Summary Endings *(fiction only)*

Last paragraph summarizes or moralizes what just happened. Cut it. End on action or dialogue.

---

## Gate G — Narrator Intrusion / False Agency / Narrator-from-a-Distance / Vague Attributions

### Narrator intrusion *(fiction)*

```
Flagged:  "What she didn't know was..."
Flagged:  "The reason he ... was because..."
Flagged:  Evaluative aside that steps outside character POV
Fix:      Stay in POV. Show the character's perception only.
```

### False agency *(all content)*

Inanimate things doing human verbs. Name the actual human actor.

```
Flagged:  "the decision emerges" → Someone decided.
Flagged:  "the culture shifts" → People changed behavior.
Flagged:  "the data tells us" → Readers who finished chapter 1 are more likely to...
Flagged:  "the debt stopped being the point" → She stopped caring about the debt.
Flagged:  "the market rewards" → Buyers pay for...
Flagged:  "a complaint becomes a fix" → The team fixed it.
Fix:      Name the human. If no specific person fits, use "you."
```

### Narrator-from-a-distance *(all content)*

Put the reader in the room, not above it.

```
Flagged:  "Nobody designed this." → "You don't sit down one day and decide to..."
Flagged:  "There's a specific kind of story that..." → Name the story directly.
Flagged:  "There is a specific pleasure in..." → State what happens in the story.
Flagged:  "People tend to..." → "You tend to..."
Flagged:  "This happens because..." → Name who did it and when.
```

### Vague attributions *(copy)*

Claiming authority without naming the source.

```
Flagged:  "Experts argue that..."
Flagged:  "Industry reports suggest..."
Flagged:  "Observers have cited..."
Flagged:  "Studies show..." (with no study named)
Fix:      Name the expert, study, or person. If you can't, cut the claim.
```

### Sentence starters to avoid *(copy)*

```
Flagged:  Sentences starting with What, When, Where, Which, Who, Why, How
Fix:      Lead with the subject or verb.
Example:  "What makes this hard is..." → "The constraint is [specific thing]."
```

---

## Gate H — Composition & Tone Tropes *(articles + copy)*

These operate at the level of the full piece, not individual sentences. Run Gate H after Gates A–G when reviewing articles, essays, or copy.

### False vulnerability

Performative self-awareness inserted to disarm skepticism — "I know this seems obvious, but..." / "I'll be the first to admit..." / "And yes, since we're being honest..." AI uses this to sound human. It reads as manipulation because real vulnerability is specific and uncomfortable; AI vulnerability is polished and risk-free.

Fix: Remove. State the point.

### Grandiose stakes inflation

Treating a narrow topic as civilization-defining. "This will fundamentally reshape how we think about everything." / "We're at a crossroads." / "will define the next era of computing."

Fix: Scope the claim to what the evidence supports.

### Invented concept labels

Naming a phenomenon with a compound neologism used as if it's an established term: "the supervision paradox," "the acceleration trap," "workload creep." The label is invented on the spot to sound incisive. Multiple such labels in the same piece is a strong AI signal.

Fix: Describe the phenomenon in plain language. If the label is genuinely useful, define it explicitly.

### Fractal summaries

"What I'm going to tell you; what I'm telling you; what I just told you" — applied at every level. Every subsection gets a summary. Every section gets a summary. The piece itself gets a summary. All structure, no content.

Fix: One summary per piece, at the end. Open sections with a point, not a preview of the point.

### Dead metaphor

A single metaphor introduced early and then beaten through every subsequent paragraph. "The model is a toolbox" → tools, hammer, wrench, workshop, craftsmanship, blueprint — for 1,500 words.

Fix: Use the metaphor once or twice. Then switch to literal language.

### Historical analogy stacking

Rapid-fire historical examples or company names stacked to build false authority without developing any of them. "Apple didn't build Uber. Facebook didn't build Spotify. Stripe didn't build Shopify..." / "Like the printing press. Like the internet. Like the industrial revolution."

Fix: Develop one analogy fully. Cut the others.

### One-point dilution

A single argument restated in different words across thousands of words. Each section rephrases the thesis with a different metaphor but adds nothing new. An 800-word argument padded to 4,000 words.

Fix: Find the one sharpest formulation. Cut everything that rephrases it rather than advancing it.

### "Despite its challenges..." formula

Acknowledging downsides with a dismissive clause before pivoting to enthusiasm: "Despite its challenges, X represents..." / "While there are concerns, Y offers..." AI uses this as a balance-seeking reflex that dismisses every objection without engaging it.

Fix: Either engage the challenges seriously or drop the acknowledgment.

### Signposted conclusion

"In conclusion..." / "To sum up..." / "In summary..." as a conclusion opener. Competent writing doesn't announce itself. The reader can feel when it's ending.

Fix: Cut the signpost. Start with the actual final point.

### Triple-value lists

Three abstract virtues listed in "X, Y, and Z" form with no specifics: "excellence, collaboration, and innovation." Sounds principled, says nothing.

Fix: Pick the one that matters and say something specific about it.

### Uncontracted forms as stiffness signal *(copy)*

Consistent use of "it is", "do not", "is not", "we are", "they have" with zero contractions anywhere. Real writing uses contractions.

Flag if: 2+ uncontracted forms exist and no contractions appear anywhere in the text.

Fix: "It is" → "it's", "do not" → "don't", "we are" → "we're".

## Scoring *(copy — rate 1–10 on each)*

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Directness | Statements or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied or metronomic? |
| Trust | Respects reader intelligence? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human? |
| Density | Anything cuttable? |
| Originality | Any dead metaphor, analogy stacking, or invented labels? |

Below 42/60: revise.

## Copy Application Notes

### Traffic articles (`articles/`)

- Lead with the conflict or hook — no setup paragraphs explaining what the article covers.
- Every paragraph earns its place. If cutting it doesn't break the argument, cut it.
- Short paragraphs win on mobile. 1–3 sentences, then break.
- The reader came from a Facebook ad about a book — reward that expectation fast.

### Book taglines

- No adverbs, no em dashes, no binary contrasts.
- 8–12 words max. Every word must do work.
- End on unresolved tension — never on a summary or conclusion.

### Book synopses (description field in `books.ts`)

- Lead with the conflict, not the setup.
- Introduce the protagonist and the obstacle in sentence 1–2.
- No throat-clearing ("In a world where..." / "Meet [Name], a woman who...").
- 3–5 sentences total. End on what's at stake, not a summary.

### Meta descriptions

- ≤155 characters.
- State what the book/article is about in one active sentence.
- Include the genre signal or emotional hook.
- No "Click here to read" / "Find out what happens."

## Triage Pass *(fiction chapters — run before any rewriting)*

Before touching a single chapter, do a fast read-only scan of all chapters and output a severity table:

```
| Chapter | Banned words/1k | Consecutive templates | Gates triggered | Severity |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| ch-001  | 4               | 1                    | A               | mild    |
| ch-002  | 11              | 3                    | A B C           | moderate|
...
```

Rules:
- Scan by reading each chapter once — do not rewrite anything yet.
- Assign severity (mild / moderate / severe) per the Detection table above.
- Chapters with **zero** banned words and no Gate triggers: mark `clean` — **skip entirely**, do not process.
- Group results: clean (skip) → mild (Pass 1 only) → moderate (Pass 1+2) → severe (all 3 passes).

This triage pass typically saves 30–50% of total tokens on a full book by skipping clean chapters and limiting mild chapters to one pass.

---

## Three-Pass Method *(fiction chapters)*

Execution order:
1. Run the triage pass first and output the severity table.
2. Process chapters by severity group: clean chapters are skipped, mild get Pass 1, moderate get Pass 1+2, severe get all three passes plus targeted rewrites.
3. Output a De-Slop Report after each processed chapter.

- **Pass 1 — Deabstract**: Gates A, C (abstract emotion), D (uniform rhythm), G (narrator intrusion)
- **Pass 2 — Deliteralize**: Gates A (literary register), B (sentence templates)
- **Pass 3 — Restore natural voice**: Gates D (short/long rhythm mix), E (dialogue differentiation), F (ending de-moralization), add sensory detail

| Severity | Passes |
|----------|--------|
| Clean | skip |
| Mild | Pass 1 |
| Moderate | Pass 1 + Pass 2 |
| Severe | All 3 + targeted rewrites |
